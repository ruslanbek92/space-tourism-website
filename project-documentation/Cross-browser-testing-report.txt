On Device simulators, on iPhones, iPads with Safari 14, and on other devices with Chrome below 80, css gap property didn't worked as it was not supported. 
This problem is fixed with feature detecting JS code and substituting gap effect with css margin.

Results
All functionality behaved as expected in all browsers and versions, except css gap property, and css height:auto not worked in Safari 14 and below version. 
Problem with css gap is solved as same problem solved in previous pages. 
Due to the bug(?) in the SAfari 14 and below versions browser didn't calculate images aspect ratio properly and gave image a height mentioned in the html in all resoulitions. Which caused the image get stretched in naroower windows. Simply, browser didn't use height:auto property in a proper way. To tackle this, I had to detect Safari 14 and below versions with JS feature detection code, and in main.js inside tab click handler function , in the switch case I have given appropriate class names to each image which can be used  in css in giviving each image calculated height based on each images aspect ratio.
